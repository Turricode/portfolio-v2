# Hello World

This is my first post. This blog goes over a series of projects I have either worked on in the past or am working on at the moment.
For some context my name is Francisco Torrinha, I have been programming for a few years now and am currently working for a media and entertainment company out of Oporto, Portugal.

## What kinds of projects are being shared

Essentially any projects I have an interest in, this usually includes [generative art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_art), small web projects, and 3D/2D graphics. You might also find some guides describing how to solve problems I have come across and struggled to solve.
